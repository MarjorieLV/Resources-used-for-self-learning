!!WIP!!

Having a mentor to guide you is my best recommendation.

I Started with the School 42 piscine. It's a month of intense programming with a lot of exercices.
You can find pdf of the exercices here : https://github.com/MrRobb/42_piscine (scroll down)
Videos lesson (in french :disappointed: ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm_ms3d5Jwc&list=PLIXVN1KHt2a7UuyDroq9QLJm0sMGfgDj8
You can also do the Open classroom C Language course before doing the exercices. (also look for some linux course)

After this do a few simple projects like :
- A command line calculator that can support infinite numbers. (need +/-* and priorities () )
- Recode a simple ls
- create a mini-shell

Then I moved on to c++ (you can also do java or c#)
Do various project, try to find something that interest you. You can google lots of small project idea. (keep it simple !)
eg : Library management, booking system, todolist

After a few project,
You can now read Cracking the coding interview. This is not yet to prepare for interview but to use it as guide to what to learn next.
Use the chapter as area you need to learn about.
You can also start to dabble into various other language like python javascript etc.
but don't do too much, I would say pick one main language and one side language.
Then choose what you want to specialize in, there is plenty of resource on the web
Eg : want to do web stuff ? do javascript, learn about backend/front  library etc.
Want to work on micro controller ? play with arduinos
Mobile app ? Have a look for android or ios tutorial
Take the Coursera algorithm/data structure course from standford one is really good.

After about few month of coding and data structure/algorithm course, you can start do small problem solving exercise
Training : 1 to 3 exercise per day (2 easy, 1 medium)
It will take a while at the beginning. Try to not spend more than an hour on a exercise. (The first few hundred will be painful)
- Hackerrank
- Leetcode
- Geeksforgeeks

Various resource :
- Cracking the coding interview : This is your guide. Use the chapters to know what to learn.
- Algorithm design manual  From skiena
- Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) ( A bit verbose )
- MIT courses videos

If you want to specialize in c++ :
- Effective C++ (must read)
- CppCon videos
- Isocpp.com (FAQ is really good)
- Cplusplus.com (edited)
